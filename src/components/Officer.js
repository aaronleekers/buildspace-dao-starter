                  The DAO needs officers to run effectively. Ideal officers are CS majors and business majors who are interested in working on a project that will teach them about the digital technology industry and economics. The role of an officer is somewhat vague, this is to allow for officers to jump to the necessary roles as they are further defined by the officers of the DAO.           
                </p>
                <p>
                  Holders of Officer NFTs will be airdropped 5x more governance tokens than holders of Member NFTs. This is to allow for the voice of the leadership and the members to be weighted proportionally in terms of DAO involvement.

                <p>
                  The mission of the officers and the DAO is also somewhat loose. However, there are a few imperatives that are laid out here to ensure the DAO has potential to remain present on campus. They are as follows:
